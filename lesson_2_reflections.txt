What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a git repository you are creating it, though no files are tracked to have their future commits saved. You need to do it in order to actually use version control.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different as it is a middleman. The value it offers is located in its name, staging; it's here where you lay everything out and make the decision on what will be committed.
