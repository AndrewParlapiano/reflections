When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If the project you're working on is particularly large, or if you're redundantly backing it up in multiple locations.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So you're not flooded with commits you don't need, or, if you change your mind regarding some code, it doesn't get added to your working directory automatically.
